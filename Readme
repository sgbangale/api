npm init

npm install typescript -s

Inside our package.json we will put a script called tsc:
"scripts": {
    "tsc": "tsc"
},

npm run tsc -- --init
This command initializes the typescript project by creating the tsconfig.json file. 
Within this file we will uncomment the outDiroption and choose a location for the transpiled .js files to be delivered


npm install express -s

Express and Typescript packages are independent. The consequence of this is that Typescript does not “know” types of Express classes. 
There is a specific npm package for the Typescript to recognize the Express types.

npm install @types/express -s
